About Pinterest App :

Pinterest is a visual discovery engine and social platform, designed to find and save information in the form of comment boards. It was the fastest site in history to reach 10 million visitors per month.

About our project:

We started our project with an introduction to the Pinterest application and explained how the application can help us in our lives and explained what the problems are and what are their solutions and then we provided a background about Pinterest and developed a work plan for the implementation of the application project and mentioned the functional requirements and others and its guest to facilitate understanding the relationships between the requirements and we will use graphs 


In addition, we used graphs to design user interface models for Pinterest that illustrated the way Pinterest was used. 

In general, our project involved identifying requirements, functional and non-functional requirements, and designing solutions to solve the problems the application aims to address. Using graphs, we can easily visualize the relationship between requirements and prioritization
